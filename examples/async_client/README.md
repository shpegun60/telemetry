# Cooperative generated client

`BareMetal.cpp` runs the generated SDK and the same `DeviceClient` used by the
Qt adapter in an ordinary main loop. It has no Qt, HAL, RTOS, mutex or thread
dependency. Generate `device_api` from the example descriptor first (the test
runner does this from the actual native model).

Implement the `board_*` functions for your board. The application obtains and
fully validates the remote Descriptor, binds it to the peer/session, and passes
its observed 64-byte header through `board_verifiedDescriptorHeader()`. Matching
the generated header is a compatibility check, not peer authentication.

`board_beginPacket()` accepts a complete packet into a transport-owned TX
descriptor. The `portTx` bytes must remain unchanged until the transport releases
them; `board_txAvailable()` reports that release before another copy is made.
Backpressure is checked before handoff authorization. Partial TCP/UART progress
does not count as complete-packet acceptance. RX/DMA IRQs only publish events;
`board_pollReply()` transfers completed frames in the main loop. A Cortex-M7 port
also owns DMA memory accessibility and cache maintenance.

The client owns four stable callback/metadata slots, one 256-byte request pool,
and one generated maximum response DTO scratch. Backend and port TX/RX buffers
are separate and visible in the example. No per-request maximum DTO is reserved.

On shutdown, stop producers, call `close()`, continue the owner loop until
`drained()`, close/drain the physical and remote session, and stop the owner
before destroying storage. With FreeRTOS, one owner task runs the same `step()`;
other tasks may use the optional `ThreadSafeClient` with an RTOS mutex policy.
The mutex wrapper is a task interface; IRQ submission needs a separate ISR ring.

The [qualification runner](../../tests/async_client/run.py) executes this exact
client loop against an actual Model bridge on the host and compiles its
Cortex-M7 object. Host execution and offline ARM compilation do not establish
electrical UART/DMA behavior on a physical board.

## Optional repeated Encoded delivery

Build the same `BareMetal.cpp` with `-DTELEMETRY_EXAMPLE_RETRY_ENCODED` to select
`integration/encoded/RetryingBackend.hpp` and `RetryingEncodedBackend` with
`EncodedRetryOptions{.replyTimeoutMs=100, .maxRetries=3}`. The default remains the
non-retrying EncodedBackend. The qualification runner runs both variants against
the real host Model bridge and compiles both for Cortex-M7.

No board hooks or generated SDK calls change. Three means at most three extra
sends after the initial send, using identical TEQ1 bytes/session/request ID and
fresh handoff permission on each attempt. `board_txAvailable` must retain its
release meaning even when the reply timer expires while DMA is active. Never
overwrite a live transport copy. Report complete-packet acceptance synchronously
with the actual submission, not a delayed acceptance from a previous retry;
physical TX completion is a separate event.

The server does not deduplicate Encoded requests. Lost responses can make writes,
commands and services execute again; use only operations that permit this. A
checked response stops future retries, but cannot undo an already delivered copy.
All attempts share the existing enqueue deadline and recovery rules. UART framing
and integrity remain board-owned. No physical H753 run is implied by host/ARM tests.

## Optional FreeRTOS task port

[`FreeRtosPort.hpp`](FreeRtosPort.hpp) and [`FreeRtosPort.cpp`](FreeRtosPort.cpp)
adapt the same generated client to a single-core FreeRTOS application. The
`StaticMutex` policy uses `xSemaphoreCreateMutexStatic`; the owner task and its
stack are created with `xTaskCreateStatic`. Four request slots and one 256-byte
payload pool remain inside `DeviceClient`. Notifications wake the owner; they
carry no request or payload and add no execution queue. The completion semaphore
only joins shutdown.

Construct the port in persistent storage with a borrowed `RpcBackend` or
`EncodedBackend` or `RetryingEncodedBackend`, a millisecond clock safe for all producer tasks, and the five
`Hooks`. The backend, its buffers, callback captures and port storage must outlive
`stopAndJoin()`. `start(observedHeader, generation, priority)` is called once from
a coordinator task. Wait for `admissionStatus()` to leave `Busy`; start producers
only on `Ok`. This observed header comes from the application's fully validated,
peer-bound Descriptor, as in the cooperative example.
If admission fails, the owner closes and drains the empty client before parking;
still call `stopAndJoin()` to delete that task. A never-started port or failed task
creation has admitted no requests; its destructor closes that inert core without
callbacks. Construct and destroy these objects in task context with the scheduler
available for mutex operations.

A producer task can call `port.requestConfig(noexceptCompletionFunction)` or
`port.producers().read/write/command/service(...)`. These return the immediate
submission status, including `QueueFull`; accepted completions run on the owner
task, outside the mutex. Copy any response needed after the callback returns.
The facade is task-only: do not submit, lock, close or invoke callbacks in an ISR.
IRQ handlers publish completed transport events through the board port instead.

The owner waits up to one tick between steps; hooks, callbacks and scheduling
add time. `xTaskNotifyGive` can end that wait earlier. Only the owner touches
the backend or transport. `txAvailable`
checks release/backpressure before the owner copies a complete packet into its
separate 1024-byte TX buffer. `send` reports complete-packet acceptance, never
partial progress; the copied bytes remain leased until `txAvailable` releases
them. A failed handoff is reported conservatively. The port itself does not retry
or add a queue: the selected backend chooses whether to offer a retransmission.
`RetryingEncodedBackend` may execute an Encoded operation repeatedly; the ordinary
EncodedBackend does not retry. Neither automatically reopens an uncertain session.

To stop, first prevent new producer calls and join every producer task, including
any in-flight submission and wake call. Then call `stopAndJoin()` from the
coordinator, never from the owner or its callbacks. It closes admission, wakes
the owner, drains accepted callbacks, and calls `closeAndDrain` on that owner.
That hook must finish/cancel outstanding DMA/TX, close the remote session, and
exclude late frames from it. The owner then signals completion and stops using
the client; the coordinator deletes that other task before returning. Storage
may be destroyed only after this join. This example does not restart a port:
recovery uses a freshly validated session and an explicitly coordinated lifecycle.

Compile the `.cpp` with the generated `device_api` include root, `lib`, and your
actual FreeRTOS/configuration/CMSIS include paths, for example:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -mcpu=cortex-m7 -mthumb \
  -mfpu=fpv5-d16 -mfloat-abi=hard -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti \
  -DTINY_DELEGATE_ENABLE_HEAP_FALLBACK=0 -DSTM32H753xx \
  -Ilib -I"$SDK/cpp" -isystem "$FREERTOS/include" \
  -isystem "$FREERTOS/portable/GCC/ARM_CM4F" -isystem "$BOARD/Core/Inc" \
  -isystem "$BOARD/Drivers/CMSIS/Include" \
  -isystem "$BOARD/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32H7xx/Include" \
  -c examples/async_client/FreeRtosPort.cpp -o "$OUT/FreeRtosPort.o"
```

Choose the portable header directory configured by your actual FreeRTOS kernel;
the local H753 tree uses `GCC/ARM_CM4F`. Static allocation, mutexes,
`vTaskDelete`, `xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle` and task notifications must be enabled.
The 1024-word owner stack is an example allocation, not a measured stack bound;
size and check it for your callbacks and port. This optional example is compiled
with real local FreeRTOS headers and allocation fallback disabled; scheduler,
priority, DMA/cache and hardware behavior remain application validation work.
