# Native TCP stream integration

Optional component `tcp_server` supplies no socket, OS, queue, RPC or additional
wire envelope. It carries existing Resource v1 packets and Encoded TEQ1 frames
unchanged. One application owner controls each connection and shared Model/Workspace.

`FrameReader` consumes arbitrary partial or coalesced chunks into caller-owned
storage, returns the consumed prefix, and retains one complete frame until
`release()`. `Server::receive()` dispatches that frame through the existing
Resource or Encoded dispatcher. One pending reply blocks further ingress until
`releaseReply()`. Preserve unconsumed input; no operation execution queue exists.

## Boundaries and bootstrap

Request first bytes 1–4 select Resource LIST/STAT/READ/WRITE. Their sizes are
9/5/13 bytes or 16 plus the little-endian u16 at offset 14. First byte `0x54`
selects TEQ1, whose size is 32 plus little-endian u32 `payloadBytes` at offset20.
Full existing TEQ1 validation still applies. Bounds are checked before addition.

Resource replies require one known outstanding operation: STAT6, WRITE14,
LIST/READ12 plus u16 at offset10. A single `InvalidData` byte is never a completed
reply: EOF or timeout closes the connection. A valid normal error envelope can
start with the same byte, so it cannot be classified from that byte alone.
The server closes on malformed input instead of emitting an ambiguous short error.

Bootstrap performs sequential checked LIST/STAT/READ against a configured
Descriptor path, owns copied descriptor bytes and validates them before admission.
There are no packet retries. After one bootstrap reply, reject already-buffered
trailing bytes before issuing another request. Timeout, malformed or unsolicited
input closes the connection; never label an old reply with a new request identity.
After bootstrap the application uses existing `EncodedBackend` and its FIFO.

## Session and lifetime

The first fully validated TEQ1 request binds its nonzero session to this admitted
TCP connection. Later session mismatches and nonincreasing request IDs close it
without endpoint execution. This is connection binding, not authentication or
duplicate suppression across connections. The application validates the peer and
pins the descriptor revision; changing that revision closes the connection.

RX, TX and Workspace storage must be stable and mutually disjoint. Send only
`reply()` bytes, and call `releaseReply()` after the transport owns a full copy or
has finished reading the borrowed buffer. `close()` revokes logical access; it
does not establish physical TX/RX release or erase buffer bytes. Close/drain the
driver before destruction. Reentrant ingress is refused; closure during a native
callback prevents publishing a later reply.

For the initial single-client profile the server finishes synchronous dispatch,
closes the old socket and discards its parser state before admitting a new one.
Successful fresh descriptor bootstrap then establishes prior server context
closure. Local socket disconnection alone is not evidence of remote quiescence.

```cpp
#include <integration/tcp/Server.hpp>
// Stable Model/Workspace/files/rx/tx live longer than server and socket operations.
telemetry::integration::tcp::Server server(model.view(), workspace, files.view(), rx, tx);
// Owner retains input.subspan(result.consumed), hands server.reply() to transport,
// and calls releaseReply() only after the transport owns that complete reply.
```

CMake links `Telemetry::tcp_server`. qmake includes `tcp.pri` explicitly.
See the maintained [host tests](../../../tests/tcp_stream/README.md).
