# Optional UX codegen: installed consumer gate

The command and Python module stay unchanged:

```sh
# Headless C++ / JS / TS generator only:
python -m pip install telemetry-codegen-core==0.1.0
telemetry-codegen generate descriptor.bin --targets cpp,js,ts --output sdk

# Complete generator, including optional QML:
python -m pip install telemetry-codegen==0.1.0
telemetry-codegen generate descriptor.bin --targets qml --output sdk
```

The complete distribution is a **module-free compatibility metapackage**. Core owns
`tools.telemetry_codegen`, canonical optional JS client assets and the sole
`telemetry-codegen` console entry. The separate `telemetry-ux-codegen` package owns
only the optional emitter and pins the exact core version. No Qt installation is
required to generate text; compiling generated QML still needs Qt.

## What this suite proves

The runner prepares external source copies, builds **sdist then wheel** for all three
packages, installs them offline into fresh isolated environments, and then renames the
prepared source directories. Child processes run outside either repository with no
`PYTHONPATH`; installed module locations must belong to the venv.

- Minimal core generates frozen C++/JS/TS output, both ordinary and with optional client
  runtime/structural metadata. A meta-path guard raises on any attempted UX/PyQt/PySide
  import, including an import which a generator might otherwise silently catch.
- Core's wheel contains no six QML emitter modules. UX owns no SDK modules or console
  entry; the compatibility metapackage owns no importable modules or CLI. Dependencies
  are exact, and there is one canonical copy of every optional JS runtime asset.
- Missing QML support names the installable package and publishes no partial output,
  including for a mixed `cpp,qml` request.
- Controlled external hook modules test wrong API/IR/SDK versions (also boolean API
  masquerading as integer 1), missing/noncallable generation, wrong target/mapping
  types, list-of-pairs rejection, nonfinite symbol JSON, nested import failure,
  escaping/reserved/colliding paths and binary source text. Existing application files
  remain byte-identical after every refusal. A real `MappingProxyType` is accepted.
- Installing the full compatibility wheel resolves the real core and UX wheels without
  the source checkout. Fifteen frozen output profiles match **282 file hashes including
  manifests**, with `--check` repeated for each. The existing nine QML naming/ownership
  unit tests also execute using installed implementations and external fixture-only
  source copies from Telemetry UX. The explicit UX-owned descriptor fixture is test data;
  production parsing and generation use the installed core/UX distributions. Both
  copied UX unit sources are included in the before/after input hashes.
- Removing the metapackage leaves the core/UX implementations usable. Removing UX leaves
  the core modules and command usable, with an honest missing-extension error for QML.
- The documented migration is explicit uninstall-before-install. An **ownership-only
  fixture** gives current module/CLI bytes the old `telemetry-codegen` distribution name;
  the suite uninstalls that owner, verifies its CLI disappeared, installs the real three
  wheels, and checks exact QML output again. This tests the RECORD/CLI handoff and does
  not claim automatic upgrades are safe or execute the historical renderer version.

The old-output oracle is independently frozen from SDK commit
`4d7afbb48476b5e73c179105f89d6f639bd7bf9c`: empty/mixed/edge Descriptor goldens, each
with QML-only, all targets, all targets plus both optional flags, core-only, and core
plus both optional flags. `legacy_output_hashes.json` records every output hash and
Descriptor SHA-256. It was verified against an external archive of that actual Git
commit before accepting the moved emitter; CI does not need to fetch old history or
carry a second generator implementation.

This is a Python/package/source-output gate. Real generated Qt/QML compilation,
`QQmlEngine`, RPC and UI behavior remain covered by the [UX Qt/QML suite](https://github.com/shpegun60/telemetry-ux/blob/a336b8c2984d5adf235b0791b545a37d3da3cc8b/tests/codegen_qml/README.md); this suite
does not claim to execute Qt or hardware.

The installed core also runs 76 focused optional web-starter hook and guarded
publication controls. The full environment generates the real UX starter and
checks it without changing any legacy output profile. Browser presentation and
native-client behavior are qualified separately in Telemetry UX.

## Run

```sh
python3 -B tests/ux_codegen_extension/run.py \
  --build-dir /external/telemetry-ux-extension \
  --ux-root /path/to/telemetry-ux
```

Python 3.10+, pip, venv, setuptools and wheel must be supplied by the caller. No package
registry or tool download is used. Choose a fresh external directory; the runner never
deletes existing output. `summary.json` preserves commands/logs, actual wheel contents
and identities, profile results and SDK/UX source hashes before/after. The fixture-only
legacy owner is built in a separate wheel directory so it cannot replace the real full
metapackage artifact.
