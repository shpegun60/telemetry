# Serial ReadMany checks

```sh
python3 -B tests/read_many_serial/run.py --build-dir /tmp/read-many-serial \
  --cobs-root /path/to/cobs --qt-prefix /usr --cxx clang++-18 --sanitize
```

The build directory must be fresh and outside the source tree. The runner keeps
compiler/runtime logs, binary hashes and before/after source hashes. It opens
only host-created PTYs; it never opens a hardware serial port or a programmer.

The real console executable exchanges fragmented COBS frames with the actual
opt-in board Protocol, using Resource bootstrap and the production Encoded
dispatcher. The successful run covers 32 individual reads, 8/12/16/32-field
batches, mixed per-item results, controlled deadlines, stale replies and a fresh
session after reconnect. Negative peers send invalid TRM1 bytes and a malformed
batch reply with a valid outer CRC; neither may report success. Bootstrap tests
separately exercise pagination, opaque/nonmonotonic READ cursors, cursor-only
progress and its finite budget, exact accumulated lengths at EOF, and malformed
Resource transcripts. These cursor tests use the same bootstrap class as TCP.

The Windows build executes bootstrap and argument checks; Linux additionally
runs real PTYs. Physical TX lease ownership is separately tested by the board's
[host harness](../../examples/nucleo_h7s3l8/tests/Host.cpp), which holds UART TC
and COBS lease release independently. Physical qualification uses the guarded
[hardware runner](../nucleo_h7s3l8/README.md).
