# Installed SDK packages

The development SDK version is `0.1.0`. C++ modules, the private ESM package and
the offline Python generator can be installed independently. These are local
package workflows; no npm/PyPI release or repository rename is implied.

SDK `0.1.0`, structural metadata format `1`, Descriptor wire `3.0` and Encoded
wire `1` are separate version domains. Changing package metadata does not change
the wire protocol.

## C++ modules

Select the modules needed by the application and install into an external prefix:

```sh
cmake -S /path/to/telemetry-sdk -B /external/sdk-build -G Ninja \
  '-DTELEMETRY_COMPONENTS=read_many_static_client;batch_static_client;encoded_backend' \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/external/sdk-prefix
cmake --build /external/sdk-build --target install
```

The consumer uses only the installed prefix:

```cmake
find_package(Telemetry 0.1.0 EXACT CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS
    read_many_static_client batch_static_client encoded_backend)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE Telemetry::read_many_static_client
    Telemetry::batch_static_client Telemetry::encoded_backend)
```

Pass `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/external/sdk-prefix` when configuring the consumer.
Include paths, `Telemetry::` targets and C++ namespaces retain their existing
names. The initial package policy accepts an exact version; it does not promise
compatibility with every other `0.x` package. The prefix can be relocated.
An installation containing only interface/header modules is architecture
independent. A prefix containing compiled libraries retains the architecture
check, so build it with the intended target toolchain.

`SDKMetadata.json` under the installed data directory records the package and
wire versions. A controlled packager may set `TELEMETRY_SOURCE_REVISION` to a
40-digit Git revision. The default is empty; that optional string does not by
itself certify a clean source tree or a successful qualification run.

## Headless JavaScript and TypeScript

Create a local tarball, then install it into the application:

```sh
npm pack /path/to/telemetry-sdk --pack-destination /external/packages
cd /path/to/my-app
npm install --offline --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund \
  /external/packages/telemetry-sdk-0.1.0.tgz
```

The package is private and has no third-party runtime dependencies. Its public
entrypoints contain the canonical SDK implementation and matching declarations:

```ts
import {DeviceClient, EncodedBackend, Batch} from 'telemetry-sdk';
import {parseDescriptor} from 'telemetry-sdk/runtime';
import {DynamicClient} from 'telemetry-sdk/dynamic';
import {connectStatic, connectDynamic, demoWebSocket} from 'telemetry-sdk';
```

`telemetry-sdk/client` retains the low-level client exports. The optional
[connection Session](ConnectionSession.md) coordinates bootstrap, admission and
local cleanup over the same FIFO, with `telemetry-sdk/session` and
`telemetry-sdk/transports/websocket` as explicit subpaths.
The runtime modules need no Qt or `document`/UI framework. They use standard
JavaScript APIs such as Promise, AbortController and BigInt. Existing source-tree
imports remain supported; new applications need not copy SDK files into their UI.

The [typed Batch](../tests/client_batch_web/README.md) and
[runtime client](../tests/client_dynamic_web/README.md) consumers demonstrate the
two client styles. Use a separate backend instance for each independently owned
client/session. One client owns its FIFO.

## Offline Python generator

Install a locally built wheel into an application environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv /external/codegen-env
/external/codegen-env/bin/python -m pip install --no-index \
  /external/packages/telemetry_codegen_core-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
/external/codegen-env/bin/telemetry-codegen generate descriptor.bin \
  --targets cpp,js,ts --client-runtime --structural-metadata \
  --output /external/generated-sdk
```

On Windows, use the environment's `Scripts/python.exe` and
`Scripts/telemetry-codegen.exe`. `python -m tools.telemetry_codegen` remains a
compatible module invocation, including from the installed environment.

The headless distribution is `telemetry-codegen-core`. It owns the sole
`telemetry-codegen` command and `tools.telemetry_codegen` modules. The generator
defaults to `cpp,ts,js`. `--client-runtime` includes the same
canonical client source/distribution assets packaged in the wheel; an SDK
checkout is not required at generation time. Missing installed assets produce
an error before output publication. `--structural-metadata` is opt-in and leaves
the normal generated files unchanged. `--check` verifies existing owned output
without rewriting it. See [code generation](CodeGenerator.md) for output ownership.

The optional `telemetry-ux-codegen==0.1.0` package adds `--targets qml` and includes
the C++ target automatically. It uses the same core parser, CLI and output
transaction. Emitting it needs no Qt Python runtime; compiling its generated
module still needs the documented Qt kit. Without the extension, selecting
`qml` gives an installation diagnostic before output publication.

The same matching UX extension can emit a thin browser entry page:

```sh
telemetry-codegen generate descriptor.bin --targets js --structural-metadata \
  --ux-starter web --output /external/device-sdk
```

This explicit option requires both the JavaScript target and structural metadata.
Its three `ui` files import the generated bindings and installed `telemetry-ux/web`
presentation. `mountDevice(host, {client})` receives the application's admitted
`DeviceClient` and returns its presentation provider and unmount function. The
application owns transport, connection and session lifecycle. The UX generator
owns the starter implementation; the SDK retains parsing, output validation and
guarded publication. Default headless and QML outputs remain unchanged.

Install the matching local core and UX wheels, or use the module-free full
distribution to select both:

```sh
/external/codegen-env/bin/python -m pip install --no-index \
  --find-links /external/packages telemetry-codegen==0.1.0
```

Use a fresh environment when migrating from the older monolithic
`telemetry-codegen` package. Alternatively, explicitly uninstall the old package
**before** installing the new core/full packages:

```sh
python -m pip uninstall telemetry-codegen
python -m pip install --no-index --find-links /external/packages \
  telemetry-codegen==0.1.0
```

This is not a transparent in-place upgrade: the old monolithic distribution and
new core own the same module paths and command. Installing both owners and then
uninstalling the old one could remove the new core's files. The new full package
owns no modules or entrypoint; it only pins the matching core and UX dependencies.

Maintainers build wheels from an external prepared source copy so setuptools
build output does not enter the SDK checkout. The
[package qualification runner](../tests/sdk_packages/README.md) builds through
a source archive and then tests installed consumers with that source unavailable.

## Qualification boundary

The maintained package suite checks relocated CMake consumption and incompatible
version refusal, a packed/installed ESM consumer and strict TypeScript imports,
and a core wheel-installed CLI with canonical runtime resources. The optional
UX extension has a separate three-wheel compatibility and migration gate.
The package suite performs no
registry publication, hardware access or physical transport qualification.
